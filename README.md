# SilverStripe Green

We're consuming way too many page types. Stop the pollution, clean up the litter, and save a site tree.

Go green.

## Hippie!

**SilverStripe Green is a micro-framework that offers a design-driven approach to creating page templates that need rapid prototyping and/or rarely change.** Instead of creating new page types every time you need a new design, you can create a self-contained design that supplies its own template, CSS and a serialised content structures in the form of YAML or JSON. These are called **design modules**.

## Sound interesting?

* [Read the docs](docs/en/index.md). They're eco-friendly!
* [Watch the demo](https://vimeo.com/179834516). It's... solar powered.
